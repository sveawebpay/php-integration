/**
 * ## Introduction
 * The Svea\WebPay\WebPay and Svea\WebPay\WebPayAdmin classes make up the Svea Svea\WebPay\WebPay API. Together they provide unified entrypoints to the various Svea web services. The API also encompass the support classes Svea\WebPay\Config\ConfigurationProvider, Svea\WebPay\Response\SveaResponse and Svea\WebPay\WebPayItem, as well as various constant container classes.
 *
 * The Svea\WebPay\WebPay class methods contains the functions needed to create orders and perform payment requests using Svea payment methods. It contains methods to define order contents, send order requests, as well as support methods needed to do this.
 *
 * The Svea\WebPay\WebPayAdmin class methods are used to administrate orders after they have been accepted by Svea. It includes functions to update, deliver, cancel and credit orders et.al.
 *
 * ### Package design philosophy
 * In general, a request to Svea using the Svea\WebPay\WebPay API starts out with you creating an instance of an order builder class, which is then built up with data using fluid method calls. Note that not all methods are applicable to all payment methods, see documentation. At a certain point, a method is used to select which service the request will go against. This method then returns an service request instance of a different class, which handles the request to the service chosen. The service request will return a response object containing the various service responses and/or error codes.
 *
 * The Svea\WebPay\WebPay API consists of the entrypoint methods in the Svea\WebPay\WebPay and Svea\WebPay\WebPayAdmin classes. These instantiate order builder classes in the Svea namespace, or in some cases request builder classes in the WebService, HostedService and AdminService sub-namespaces.
 *
 * Given an instance, you then use method calls in the respective classes to populate the order or request instance. For orders, you then choose the payment method and get a request class in return. Send the request and get a service response from Svea in return. In general, the request classes will validate that all required attributes are present, and if not throw an exception stating what is missing for the request in question.
 *
 * ### Synchronous and asynchronous requests
 * Most service requests are synchronous and return a response immediately. For asynchronous hosted service payment requests, the customer will be redirected to i.e. the selected card payment provider or bank, and you will get a callback to a return url, where where you receive and parse the response.
 *
 * ### Namespaces
 * The package makes use of PHP namespaces, grouping most classes under the namespace Svea. The entrypoint classes Svea\WebPay\WebPay, Svea\WebPay\WebPayAdmin and associated support classes are excluded from the Svea namespace. See the generated documentation for available classes and methods.
 *
 * The underlying services and methods are contained in the Svea sub-namespaces WebService, HostedService and AdminService, and may be accessed, though their api and interfaces are subject to change in the future.
 *
 * ### Documentation format
 * See the provided README.md file for an overview and examples how to utilise the Svea\WebPay\WebPay and Svea\WebPay\WebPayAdmin classes. The complete Svea\WebPay\WebPay Integration package, including the underlying Svea service classes, methods and structures, is documented by generated documentation in the apidoc folder.
 *
 * ### Fluid API
 * The Svea\WebPay\WebPay and Svea\WebPay\WebPayAdmin entrypoint methods are built as a fluent API so you can use method chaining when implementing it in your code. We recommend making sure that your IDE code completion is enabled to make full use of this feature.
 *
 * ### Development environment
 * The Svea Svea\WebPay\WebPay PHP integration package is developed and tested using NetBeans IDE 7.3.1 with the phpunit 3.7.24 plugin.

	 * Use the Svea\WebPay\WebPay::deliverOrder() entrypoint when you deliver an order to the customer.

	 *
	 * The deliver order request should generally be sent to Svea once the ordered
	 * items have been sent out, or otherwise delivered, to the customer.
	 *
	 * For invoice and partpayment orders, the deliver order request triggers the
	 * invoice being sent out to the customer by Svea. (This assumes that your account
	 * has auto-approval of invoices turned on, please contact Svea if unsure).
	 *
	 * For card orders, the deliver order request confirms the card transaction,
	 * which in turn allows nightly batch processing of the transaction by Svea.
	 * (Delivering card orders is only needed if your account has auto-confirm
	 * turned off, please contact Svea if unsure.)
	 *
	 * To deliver an invoice, partpayment or card order in full, you do not need to
	 * specify order rows. To partially deliver an order, the recommended way is to
	 * use Svea\WebPay\WebPayAdmin::deliverOrderRows().
