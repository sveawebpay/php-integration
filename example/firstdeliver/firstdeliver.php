// We then add information to the order object by using the various methods in the Svea\WebPay\BuildOrder\DeliverOrderBuilder class.

// We begin by adding any additional information required by the payment method, which for an invoice order means:

// We have now completed specifying the order, and wish to send the payment request to Svea. To do so, we first select the invoice payment method:

// Then send the request to Svea using the doRequest method, and immediately receive the service response object
